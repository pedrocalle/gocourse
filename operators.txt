Logical Operators:

    ! (logica NOT) !true = false
    || (logical OR)     a > b || a > c - One condition must check
    && (logical AND)    a > b && a > c  - All conditions must check

Bitwise Operators:

    & (bitwise AND)
    | (bitwise OR)
    ^ (bitwise XOR)
    &^ (bit clear, AND NOT)
    << (left shift)
    >> (right shift)

Comparison Operators:

    == (equal)
    != (not equal)
    < (less than)
    <= (less than or equal to)
    > (greater than)
    >= (greater than or equal to)
